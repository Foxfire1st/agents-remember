"""CLI adapter: ingest an orchestrator's curator hand-off list into a leaf's candidate.

    agents-remember knowledge-ingest --contract <leaf enclosure contract>
        --list <hand-off list> --candidate-directory <dir>
        --authorization-ref <ref> [--dry-run]

``--contract`` is REQUIRED and is the write guard, exactly as ``memory-citations`` and
``memory-backfill`` use it: the operation reads the code and memory repositories the contract
names and writes into the candidate directory the caller supplies, so there is no argument list
that can aim a knowledge write at another leaf's line.

``--authorization-ref`` is REQUIRED for the same reason the operation requires one: an admitted
write needs an authorship envelope, and ``Authorship`` refuses a blank reference. The same
reference is the actor the envelope names, so "who authorized this" and "who authored it" stay one
recorded fact instead of two strings that can disagree.

PLANNING IS THE DEFAULT, AND PLANNING IS ALSO THE DRY RUN. Without ``--commit`` this reads the
list, resolves every target, reports every outcome and writes nothing; the report's own
``dry_run`` field says which mode produced it. ``--commit`` is the developer's commit word and the
only mode that writes rows.

Exit status: 0 when every entry reached a terminal outcome the report names -- committed, a
ruling, or a typed refusal -- and 2 when the invocation itself is refused (a missing or
unreadable list, a blank authorization reference, a contract this command cannot load). A refusal
per entry is a *result*, not a tool failure: the report is the product, and a caller branching on
the exit code would otherwise lose it.

This is the production caller for :func:`agents_remember.application.knowledge_curator_ingest.
ingest_curator_list`. The mounted ``knowledge_change`` tool does NOT write and says so; the write
plane's reachable entry points are this subcommand and the operation it calls.
